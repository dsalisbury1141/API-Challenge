This was a great learning exercise 

Observations: 
1. It took me a while to query the cities list within the API. I had to narrow down each list item and print
2. The next challenge was to collect the hotels and lodging within the allotted areas, this took me several hours but was a good challenge.
3. I notice each time or day I pull the city from the dictionary I get different results, new cities with the requirements of the weather input
